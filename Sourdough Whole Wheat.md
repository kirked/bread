# Sourdough Whole Wheat

## Day 1

### Step 1: Barm

```
1 c       unbleached bread flour
½ c       water, room temp.
¼ c       sourdough starter
```

Stir together in mixing bowl (with room to grow), ensuring that no dry flour is left. Cover with wrap for 6 hours, or until it's very bubbly.

### Step 2: Firm Starter

```
½c        barm from above
1c        whole wheat flour
about ¼ c water, room temp.
```

Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix together all ingredients, ensuring no dry flour remains (add water if necessary), just until it comes together. Switch to the dough hook and knead for 4-6 minutes. Lightly spray with coconut oil spray so the ball is coated, cover and let sit 4-6 hours until doubled in size.

Seal the risen firm starter with plastic wrap, place in an airtight container, and refrigerate overnight. This slows the yeast action and allows enzymes to convert more starch to sugars.

## Day 2

### Step 3: Bread

```
3½ c      whole wheat flour
1½ tsp    salt
1 to 1⅓ c water, lukewarm (90-100˚F)
```

Next morning, remove firm starter from the refrigerator and cut into 10-12 pieces, cover with plastic wrap and allow to warm for 60-90 minutes. To a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add the water, salt, flour, and start mixing. Add the firm starter pieces one at a time. Continue until well-mixed, then switch to the dough hook to knead for 6-8 minutes. Remove the dough hook, spray lightly with coconut oil to coat the bowl, then let rise for 4-6 hours (until doubled in size).

Lightly punch down the dough on the counter, divide into 2 balls. Then shape into loaves and place in loaf pans or on a cooking sheet. Let rise again in a draft-free place (like a room-temperature oven) for another 4 hours.

Remove pans from oven, and preheat the oven to 500˚F. Prepare another metal pan with some warm water, and place in the oven on the bottom rack once the oven reaches 400˚F, still waiting for it to heat all the way to 500. This should develop a nice steamy environment.

Once the oven reaches 500˚, add the bread loaves on the top rack and bake for 15 minutes. Then turn down the oven to 450˚ and bake for another 15-20 minutes.

Ideally, use an oven thermometer or an instant-read thermometer to check the temperature in the middle of the bread. The bread should be 200˚ when it's ready to remove from the oven. A clean toothpick test (as for cakes) will work if no thermometer's available.

Let the bread cool for 45 minutes before slicing so the moisture will stay in. If you cut it sooner, the bread will dry out prematurely because you've let the steam out.
